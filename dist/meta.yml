  Description: |
    <p className="text-sm">
      This part contains the <strong>norV promoter (PnorV)</strong> from <i>E. coli</i> K12 TOP10, designed as a nitric oxide (NOx) detector. In the presence of NOx, PnorV activates downstream gene expression, enabling protein production in response to environmental NOx.
    </p>
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 text-sm">
      <li><strong>NOx Detection:</strong> Senses nitric oxide via the native norV promoter, regulated by NorR.</li>
      <li><strong>Biological Context:</strong> PnorV controls the nitric oxide reduction operon (norRVW) in <i>E. coli</i>. NorR binds NO and activates gene expression.</li>
      <li><strong>Characterization:</strong> PnorV was cloned upstream of superfolder GFP and tested in <i>E. coli</i> using DETA/NO as an NO source. Activation requires native NorR, as shown by loss of response in a norR knockout strain.</li>
      <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Useful for constructing biosensors to detect and quantify NOx in bacterial systems.</li>
    </ul>
    <p className="mt-2 text-sm">
      This part is valuable for synthetic biology applications requiring sensitive detection of nitric oxide, and has been characterized using both plate reader and flow cytometry assays to assess dose response and expression noise.

  Description: |
    <p className="text-sm">
      This part contains the <strong>pNorVÎ² promoter</strong>, an optimized nitric oxide sensitive promoter regulated by NorR. The corresponding integration host factor IHF2 binding site was removed from the promoter pNorV to exhibit good sensitivity and dosage response at a low range of inducer DETA/NO, activating downstream genes' transcription.

    <p className="text-sm">
      This part contains the <strong>Secretory-abundant heat soluble protein 33020 "SAHS 33020"</strong> with T7 promoter, RBS and double terminator, designed by Guillermo Serena Ruiz from iGEM17_TUDelft (2017-10-04). This composite BioBrick features the basic part BBa_k2306003 that codes for the production of the tardigrade intrinsically disordered protein (TDP) "SAHS 33020".
    </p>
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 text-sm">
      <li><strong>T7 Promoter:</strong> BBa_I712074 for inducible overexpression with IPTG.</li>
      <li><strong>RBS:</strong> BBa_K2306014 for efficient translation initiation.</li>
      <li><strong>SAHS 33020:</strong> One of several heat soluble proteins found in tardigrades capable of protecting other fragile biological parts upon desiccation by generating a crystal matrix.</li>
      <li><strong>Double Terminator:</strong> Consisting of a rrnB T1 terminator and T7Te terminator BBa_B0015.</li>
    </ul>
    <p className="mt-2 text-sm">
      <strong>Function:</strong> This tardigrade protein can be combined with other perishable biological material (e.g., proteins) to increase its stability after dehydration or even enable the possibility of stabilizing material with just a previous drying step. The protein generates a glass-like matrix that substitutes water and protects cellular components, which redissolves upon rehydration, leaving behind undamaged functional cells.
    </p>
    <p className="mt-2 text-sm">
      <strong>Background:</strong> Tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs) are found in tardigrades, microscopic animals known for surviving in harsh conditions including space. The SAHS (Secretory Abundant Heat Soluble) proteins are produced upon hydric stress or desiccation and were discovered by Boothby et al. (2017) to be responsible for the unmatched resilience of tardigrades towards desiccation.
    </p>
    <p className="mt-2 text-sm">
      <strong>Applications:</strong> This part was employed in TU Delft's project for the expression and production of SAHS 33020, and is valuable for synthetic biology applications requiring protein stabilization during desiccation processes.
